<summary><h3>About Me</h3></summary>
The interactive space, as we experience playing games, is not just a Cartesian coordinate system for representing objects, characters, narrative, or sound... I believe that there is a much deeper understanding of space in video games that we implicitly live as we play them. Space is created the second a player sits down and begins playing a game. Most of the time we think of this as a dialogical ‘interactive space’ — the player issues a command to the computer, and the game responds in some way, which the player responds to, ad infinitum. When we think of interaction in this way, we think of the player and game in some kind of unfolding dialogue with one another. But I see the player doing something different when they act in an interactive space. This space is not real but responses are, the compelling power of belief that this space carries is what I find most appealing. Believing and keeping an Innovative attitude, I believe, leads to a constant learning process. This approach adds to the already immense potential for innovation that exists in this field.

I have recently completed my education at Thompson Rivers University during this period I realized my strengths and Achilles heel, my interests and aversions, my future, and my compassion. I found that I'm scholarly in the sector of creation but I'm not intimidated by the prospect of striving hard in life. I have completed many solo and group projects. Where I got familiar with many different components of programming and video game development. I know my way around a multitude of software and continued to learn programming languages such as C# and Java. Due to this, I developed a problem-solving mindset, analytical skills, and accuracy. These tools have helped me to understand and expand my technical abilities and instigated a growth mindset within me.

My studies and past work experiences proved instructive and inspiring. The classes that I took gave me a firm grounding in the theory of programming, architecture design, application development, and mathematics. As nothing remains constant, so is true in the case of technology. It is impossible to progress without changes. I would like to research and specialize in the field of Video Game Development, in which I have a keen interest. Most importantly past few years of my learning helped to solidify my determination to devote my long-term career to this area. I continue to work on personal projects and programming problems as I believe that learning should be a continuous process and one should always remember "Progression, not Perfection".The interactive space, as we experience playing games, is not just a Cartesian coordinate system for representing objects, characters, narrative, or sound...
